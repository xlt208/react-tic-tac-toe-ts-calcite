# React Tic-Tac-Toe

A personal learning project built with **React and TypeScript**.

This project is based on [the React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) and extended with additional improvements to reinforce my understanding of React fundamentals and TypeScript usage in a real project.

## Enhancements Beyond the Tutorial

In addition to completing the tutorial, I made the following enhancements:

- Migrated the project from JavaScript to TypeScript and made the codebase fully TypeScript-compliant for improved type safety and maintainability.
- Replaced native HTML elements with [Calcite Design System](https://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/) components for improved consistency and accessibility.
- Added a restart flow that lets players spin up a new game with any board size from 3 to 10, not just the original 3×3.
